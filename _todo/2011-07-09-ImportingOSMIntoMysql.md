In the [previous
post](http://rkj.github.com/devcamp/josm/openstreetmap/ruby/parser/tutorial/2011/07/05/Parsing-OpenStreetMap-JOSM-data.html)
I have described how to parse JOSM file and select interesting entries. Today I
would like to show simple code using [DataMapper](http://datamapper.org/) that imports resulting data into simple MySQL database

.
