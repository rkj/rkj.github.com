When I was preparing for tech interview at [Google](http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/joininggoogle/interview/index.html) I was coding many different algorithms, solved quizes and so on.

One of the problems was to find an intersection between two unsorted lists (or making a DB join). I knew that I should iterate over bigger collection in the outer loop, but did not know why

Does it happen to you too?
